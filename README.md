A look at building NLP pipelines, as well as deriving and interpreting data mining metrics for linguistic data. We create scripts in Python to process, explore, and predictively model South Park speech data. In this repository, you'll find South Park quotes expressed in csv format by Kaggle,
Python code snippets for structuring and analyzing said data, and a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates and explains the underlying thought process and logic. 

Contents 
1. Python script 'south_park_nlp.py' for structuring, analyzing and predicting information from South Park linguistic data. 
2. Jupyter notebook 'south_park_nlp-.ipynb' in which previously mentioned script is explained and outlined. 
3. The raw South Park speech data from Kaggle used by this project, in csv format.
