An exploration of structuring, analyzing and interpreting South Park speech provided by Kaggle. We first explain how to represent South Park quotes with various NLP pre-processing techniques, such as tokenization and lemmatization, which are implemented in Python. Then, we design and implement metrics for finding characters' indicative speech patterns with Bayesian statistics and discrete math. We create scripts in Python to process, explore, and predictively model South Park speech data. 

In this repository, you'll find the following contents.

# Contents 
1. Python script 'south_park_nlp.py' for structuring, analyzing and predicting information from South Park linguistic data. 

2. Jupyter notebook 'south_park_nlp-.ipynb' in which previously mentioned script is explained and outlined. 

3. The raw South Park speech data from Kaggle used by this project, in csv format.
